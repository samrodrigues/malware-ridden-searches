      Wikipedia is the Popular Website with the Least Trackers
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Chive is a ‘bro-bait’ website, well-stocked with dank memes, improbably-proportioned nudes, and jaw-dropping listicles. When no click is too cheap, it’s no wonder The Chive’s business model revolves around hidden trackers: advertisers recognize The Chive’s lure but are wary of advertising on the site itself. The Chive is loaded with 143 different trackers, of which 92 are used for advertising.
    In cases where two sites have the same amount of trackers, the site with the most average trackers per page appears first in the rankings.

      Indeed, news and ‘lifestyle’ sites dominate the top of the tracker chart. In the case of news companies, perhaps it’s because they, too, must be wary about the visible advertising on their pages.

      At the low-end of the scale, Wikipedia and the Tiktok homepage are tied for ‘least tracky’ website, with just three trackers each. Wikipedia’s privacy summary notes that “that some of these [tracking] technologies do not have the best reputation in town and can be used for less-than-noble purposes” – and that the company uses automatically-received data to “administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism.”
