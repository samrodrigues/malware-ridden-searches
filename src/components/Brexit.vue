      Post-Brexit Surge in UK Removal Requests Now Waning </h3>
    <p>
      Like the US, the UK saw a spike in removal requests in 2017. But, in the UK’s case, the trend had already begun
      with a leap in Privacy and Security- and Violence-related requests in 2016, the year of Brexit. Requests in these
      categories actually shrank again in 2017, but the year’s total remains the UK’s highest due to a 225.66% leap in
      National Security-themed requests.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      In 2020, the UK’s requests reached their lowest since 2014: 200 in total, of which 38% were Defamation-related.
      These <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/government-requests?hl=en_GB&request_country=period:;authority:GB&lu=request_country" target="_blank">included</a> “a defamation request from the Embassy of Israel [in the UK] to delist a blog post from Google
      Search claiming a former Ambassador to the United Kingdom engaged in inappropriate sexual relations.” As a result,
      Google delisted the offending URL from the google.co.uk domain.</p>
