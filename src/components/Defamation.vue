      Defamation is Leading Reason for Removal Requests Among Most Demanding Countries
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our next table reveals the top reason each of the 25 most demanding countries issue takedown requests. Russia’s
      extravagant number of National Security alerts may be down in part to the contentious political scene and in part
      to a form of ‘strong-arming’ powerful global web platforms. </p>
    <p>
      The government’s communications watchdog <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-gives-google-one-day-delete-banned-content-threatens-slowdown-2021-05-24/"
        target="_blank">claims</a> Google has been too slow removing material from alleged ‘extremist organizations’ at
      the same time as restricting YouTube access to Russian media platforms. “This censorship of Russian media and the
      targeted support for illegal protest activity actually speak to the political coloring of Google's activities in
      Russia,” according to the Russian watchdog. </p>

      Defamation is the most prevalent cause for requests among the rest of the countries in the table. EU residents can
      request certain results be omitted from Google Search as part of the poetically-named ‘<a

        target="_blank">right to be forgotten</a>.’ However, the US government makes thousands of Defamation-related
      takedown requests each year, and many of these are aimed at altering
