        This study analyzes data from <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/" target="_blank">Googleâ€™s Transparency Report</a>. We filtered the data by location, volume of requests
        between 2011-2020, volume of requests in 2020 alone, and the top reason for requests in each country and
        globally. Our goal was to reveal which government bodies around the world submit the most requests to Google to
        remove content and why. Data was gathered in October 2021.
