        We compiled a list of the most popular websites around the globe using SimilarWeb and AllYouCanRead. The number of trackers, as well as their type (advertising, social media, etc.) and owner (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), were taken from WhoTracks.Me. Sites with the highest number of "total trackers seen" were deemed to be tracking their users most actively.
      </p><p>
    In cases where two sites have the same amount of trackers, the site with the most average trackers per page appears first in the rankings.
