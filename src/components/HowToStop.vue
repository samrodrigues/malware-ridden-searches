      How to Stop Trackers in their Track    </h3>
    <p>
      Advertising trackers are a deal with the devil, so they say. In return for free content and functionality, we allow trackers into our homes, workplaces, anywhere we take our devices (whether we use them there or not).

    </p><p>
    But understanding trackers better is the key to getting a better deal. Figure out which trackers you can switch off and how to do it, and you’ll feel much more comfortable about the digital portrait that ‘big data’ has of you. A digital portrait that most of us would prefer to be a blurry at best.

      A virtual private network (VPN) is a good start. When you install a VPN on your computer or device, you route your data through an anonymous third-party server. It effectively looks like somebody on a different device in another country is doing the clicking. Of course, things you do while logged in to a particular website may still be tracked.

      In this guide to trackers and how to stop them, we offer a simple explanation of what the technology means and how to evade it. (Or you could always just read PDFs.)

      Online trackers don’t just affect individuals. They compromise our collective security. They skew our collective culture, adding false value to anything that can be clicked and counted – and deprioritizing the thoughts and feelings that can’t be tracked.     </p>
