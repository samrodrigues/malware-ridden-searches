      to buy advertising space on a page you just landed on. To move that fast,
      they have to track you pretty close.

    <p>
      To do that, websites and apps use a combination of cookies,
      <a href="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Tracking_Pixel" target="_blank"
        >invisible pixels</a

      Surfshark found that some of the most commonly-used websites conceal over
      100 trackers each. After our guide to the
      <a href="https://surfshark.com/apps-that-track-you" target="_blank"
        >apps that use the most and least trackers</a
      >, we took a tour through a typical web user’s daily browse. We used
      <a href="https://whotracks.me/" target="_blank">WhoTracks.Me</a> to count
      the trackers on the most popular websites and see who owns them.

      We’ve created a footprint of our tour below, followed by details about the
      most and least tracky websites you might use. And finally, we’ve provided
      a guide to exactly how trackers work – and how you can escape them.
