      Ever get the feeling you’re being followed?
</p><p>
      It takes online advertisers under 10 milliseconds to buy advertising space on a page you just landed on. To move that fast, they have to track you pretty close.
  </p><p>

      To do that, websites and apps use a combination of cookies, invisible pixels, and device profiling – collectively known as trackers. They sell information about who you are and what you looked at to advertising companies. These companies cross-reference your profile with GPS (where you are and even who you’re with) and other data to figure out what you want.

      That’s why you get ads for skirting boards after a walk in the park with your DIY-enthusiast brother-in-law, even though you have zero interest in skirting boards.

      Surfshark found that some of the most commonly-used websites conceal over 100 trackers each. After our guide to the apps that use the most and least trackers, we took a tour through a typical web  user’s daily browse. We used WhoTracks.Me to count the trackers on the most popular websites and see who owns them.

      We’ve created a footprint of our tour below, followed by details about the most and least tracky websites you might use. And finally, we’ve provided a guide to exactly how trackers work – and how you can escape them.
