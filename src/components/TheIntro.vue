    <p class="mb-6 text-left">The internet just keeps getting bigger. And the more content goes up, the more there is to
      take down. </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">
      Since 2009, Google has regularly announced the number of content removal requests it receives from national
      governments and their agencies. </p>

      Whether it’s a matter of censorship, <a href="https://surfshark.com/apps-that-track-you" target="_blank">privacy</a>, or security depends on where you’re sitting – and what you know. But
      what we do know is how many requests have been made and which countries they’ve come from. Surfshark has analyzed
      Google’s files to provide, below, more granular context than the official news releases reveal.
