    <p class="mb-6 text-left">The internet is great, isn’t it? It allows us to entertain and educate ourselves from wherever we are in the world, providing an abundance of information that’s easily accessible, and right at your fingertips. </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">But that’s also part of the problem. What’s easy to access can also be easy to hack.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left"><a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/94647-exponential-increase-in-malware-and-exploit-activities" target="_blank">Cyberattacks have increased exponentially</a> in both frequency and sophistication over the years. Cyber attacks are unwelcome attempts to steal, publish, modify, disable, or destroy information through unauthorized access to computer systems.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">Hackers try to lure internet users into visiting web pages or clicking download links that contain malicious software or malware that can result in any or all of these unwelcome actions. They achieve this by targeting keywords they know will get lots of interest and traffic. Terms they know have widespread appeal and are trending.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">To give internet users the best chance at protecting themselves from falling into the cyberattack trap, Surfshark has discovered which pop culture search terms are the most dangerous to search for online - from celebrity names to TV shows.</p>

    <h4 id="our_methodology" class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Our Methodology</h4>

    <p class="mb-6 text-left">We started by curating seed lists of the most popular search terms across a variety of pop culture categories. For example, the top Anime shows were pulled from the
      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity" target="_blank">MyAnimeList</a> popularity leaderboard, while the top
      <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/artist-100/" target="_blank">artists</a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/" target="_blank">songs</a> were in part sourced from Billboard end-of-year lists.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">We then input these search terms into Google with different qualifiers depending on the category. "Torrent" and "Download" were added individually to all search terms to create new queries. In addition, "Stream" was added to TV shows, anime, and sports teams, while "MP3" was added to the songs.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">The last step was to collected URLs from the first five pages of search results and ran them through a malware detector (https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/). The "% of URLs with potential malware" metric reflects the % of URLs that were flagged as "medium risk" or above by this tool.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-left">Here’s an example of the first page of Google results for those looking for a torrent site where to download Finding Dory:</p>
