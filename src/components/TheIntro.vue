    <p class="mb-6 text-left">Late-night TV used to be something to fall asleep to.</p>
    <p>
      Now we have video-on-demand, it’s what keeps you up all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, like late-night pizza, it doesn’t need to be high quality to make you take another bite.

      Netflix is the all-you-can-eat extravaganza of streaming sites. Unlike Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+, Netflix has no goal other than to make you watch more Netflix. To make you do so, the Netflix Recommender System (NRS) figures out your deepest desires and recommends the shows and movies most likely to keep you hooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the <a href="https://surfshark.com/best-rated-netflix-shows-and-movies" target="_blank">best shows</a>. The ones you, an individual with a subconscious and a viewing history, will watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Netflix knows you. Around <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13548565211014464" target="_blank">4 out of every 5 hours</a> watched on Netflix come from the algorithm’s recommendations. You have the choice to ignore Netflix’s suggested viewing - but most of us don’t.

      Inspired by Pudding.cool’s Spotify <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/" target="_blank">taste analyzer</a>, Surfshark can use IMDb ratings, critics' reviews and your search history to reveal the true awfulness of your Netflix taste. Just to you, of course.    </p>


    <h4 id="we-made" class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">We Made a Calculator that Judges Your Viewing History</h4>

    <p>
      Upload your Netflix viewing history to Surfshark’s Netflix taste calculator, and we’ll instantly compare all the films and TV episodes you’ve seen to their rating on IMDb. And then we’ll tell you:
    </p>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-5">
      <li class="mb-2">
        Your overall score out of 100.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-2">
        The worst-rated movie and TV series you’ve sat through.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-2">
        Our final judgment on the hopelessness or otherwise of your Netflix taste.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s easy to download your Netflix history. Just hit your <a href="http://www.netflix.com/YourAccount" target="_blank"><b>Account</b></a> page >
      <b>Profile and Parental Controls</b> > <b>Viewing Activity</b> (<em>Show More if necessary</em>) > <b>Download
      all</b>.     </p>
