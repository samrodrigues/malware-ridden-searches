      A Moment on the Lips, A Lifetime in the Archive
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can’t spell ‘contentious’ without ‘content’ – and Google is where many of us go to get that content fix. With
      a <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share" target="_blank">91.66%</a> cut of all search traffic and with
      <a href="https://www.panopto.com/blog/comparing-the-top-online-video-platforms/" target="_blank">billions of hours</a> of viewing time on Google’s YouTube platform each
      week, there are bound to be elements of that content that are illegal, embarrassing, or just plain dangerous. </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Google isn’t the only organization to receive <a href="https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/removal-requests.html#2020-jul-dec" target="_blank">takedown</a> requests. Nor does the search giant have the
      power to remove everything asked of it, even if they wanted to: “Sometimes,” <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/overview?hl=en_GB" target="_blank">confides</a> Google, “we even receive
      requests to remove content ‘from the Internet.’” </p>
