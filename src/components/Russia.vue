      Russia Makes All-Time Most Takedown Requests
    </h3>
    <p>

      Russia heads both tables. Although one-quarter (25.39%) of Russia’s 123,606 requests were made in 2020 alone, this fraction by itself would still be enough to double any other country’s ten-year figures. While National Security has been the primary cause for takedown requests made by the Russian government and courts, 2020’s bumper year was fueled by a massive leap in Copyright Infringement alerts.

    <p class="mb-3">
      After Russia, India, and Turkey are the countries that have made the most requests over time. But both were nudged down a spot in 2020’s figures by South Korea, which near-doubled its previous tally with 2,397 new requests. These include claims against alleged fake news on YouTube as well as blogs thought to ‘incite prostitution.’

      It’s worth noting that a single ‘request’ can cover multiple pieces of content, and multiple requests can be made against the same content. In terms of actual removals, Google took down
      <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=448330" target="_blank">54,330</a> items on South Korea’s behalf in 2020. That’s 5.37 times more than Google took down for the US during the same period.
