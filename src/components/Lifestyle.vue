      Lifestyle Websites Harbor the Most Trackers; Science and Music Sites Have
      the Fewest
    </h3>
    <p>
      Next up is our data about trackers used on popular websites across every
      category. Hit the tabs to choose the category you’d like to see.

      You’ll find that lifestyle sites tend to have the most trackers – an
      average of 63 per website. Three websites in this category have more than
      100 trackers each: throwback bro-bait sites The Chive and LADbible, and
      the relatively woke women’s lifestyle site Refinery29 (a “catalyst for
      women to see, feel, and claim their power”). This category’s average is
      pulled down by longer-established titles such as Cosmopolitan and Reader’s
      Digest, who don’t use many trackers.

      The least-tracked categories are Music and Science, both with an average
      of 33 trackers. Science’s worst offenders are the low-brow-ish Space.com
      (69) and Live Science (55), although meatier publications National
      Geographic (41) and Smithsonian Magazine (38) are also a little nosy. The
      more research-oriented Psychology Today, ScienceDaily, and Phys have just
      13-14 trackers each.

    <p class="mb-3">
      Note also the category of Most Visited, which gathers the sites with the
      most annual visits. Of these, MSN (78), Yahoo (60), and Fandom (59) are
      the worst offenders.
