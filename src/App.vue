          title: `Copycat <span>(Alfred Hitchcock on identity theft)</span>`,
          image: require("./assets/images/01-Digital-Nightmares-copycat.jpg"),
          paragraph1: `<a href="https://surfshark.com/blog/what-can-someone-do-with-your-ssn" target="_blank">Identity theft</a>! On a psychoanalytic level, your identity is a soup of experiences, relationships, and desires. But when it comes to your financial security, your identity is a jigsaw puzzle of cut-and-pasteable names and numbers. When fraudsters crack your password or hack your system, it’s only a matter of time before they build a convincing replica ‘you’ and start spending in your name. The copycat-you could even <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-59069662" target="_blank">sell your house</a>!`,
          paragraph2: `<strong>Inspiration:</strong> Saul Bass’s iconic <a href="https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/movie-poster-of-the-week-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo" target="_blank">Vertigo</a> poster was the inspiration for our cyber-era Hitchcock movie. In the original film, James Stewart falls in love with the doppelgänger of his dead lover, not realizing he is being played by unseen forces. Hitchcock was a master of the switched-identity twist. The ‘master of suspense’ had audiences covering their eyes in an era where blood and gore were minimal. One trick was to destabilize that most fundamental human value: the sanctity of identity.`

        {
          title: `Bait <span>(Jordan Peele on phishing)</span>`,
          image: require("./assets/images/02-Digital-Nightmares-bait.jpg"),
          paragraph1: `’<a href="https://surfshark.com/blog/what-is-phishing-site" target="_blank">Phishing</a>’ is a play on ‘fishing’ – criminals drop bait and wait for you to bite. That bait takes the form of a fake text message or email from your bank. Clicking the link may download <a href="https://surfshark.com/blog/what-is-malware" target="_blank">malware</a> to your device or take you to a spoof website where you feel comfortable ‘confirming your details.’ Either way, your credentials end up in the hands of bad people.`,
          paragraph2: `<strong>Inspiration:</strong> Everything is rosy in the opening moments of a Jordan Peele movie (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/movies/get-out-movie-posters-oscars.html" target="_blank">Get Out</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Us-Lupita-Nyongo/dp/B07PH2LGM2" target="_blank">Us</a>). So lovely that a genre audience already feels tense knowing the loveliness must be disrupted by murder and mayhem. But this is just one of the horror movie tropes that the contemporary filmmaker subverts. Because while classic horror launches a killer into the story from the outside, in Peele’s pictures the villain is <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/227592/what-does-jordan-peele-us-movie-title-mean" target="_blank">closer</a> – and more trusted – than you think.`

          title: `The Eye <span>(Ridley Scott on facial recognition)</span>`,
          image: require("./assets/images/03-Digital-Nightmares-the_eye.jpg"),
          paragraph1: `Cybersecurity has always been an arms race. Hackers and innocent users deploy ever more sophisticated means to outwit each other. But what happens when the next battlefield is your face? With <a href="https://surfshark.com/facial-recognition-map" target="_blank">facial recognition technology</a>, your features become biometric data. And anywhere this ‘data’ is visible (hello, Instagram), you cede precious ground in the battle for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/uks-ico-warns-over-big-data-surveillance-threat-of-live-facial-recognition-in-public/" target="_blank">privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faces-are-the-next-target-for-fraudsters-11625662828" target="_blank">security</a>.`,
          paragraph2: `<strong>Inspiration:</strong> It’s hard to pin Ridley Scott down to a style or set of thematic concerns. But if you had to, you couldn’t go far wrong with ‘dystopian <a href="http://futurecities.org.uk/2017/10/13/blade-runners-retro-futures/" target="_blank">retro-future</a> where technology backfires.’ Blade Runner, in particular, is about <em>who</em> we see and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4240951" target="_blank"><em>how</em> we see</a> – and how machines might see us.`

          title: `Pegasus Project <span>(Eduardo Sánchez / Daniel Myrick on spyware)</span>`,
          image: require("./assets/images/04-Digital-Nightmares-pegasus_project.jpg"),
          paragraph1: `Can’t they come up with a better codeword for it? <a href="https://surfshark.com/blog/can-someone-spy-on-my-phone-without-touching-it" target="_blank">Spyware</a> is software that hides on your device, and forwards text messages, passwords, location data, and even feeds from your camera and mic to a remote agent. Or spy. Crooks use this access to steal your identity or deliver precious data to advertisers and other agencies. And the Pegasus software developed by Israeli cyberarms firm NSO Group is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57910355" target="_blank">alleged</a> to have been used for surveillance on journalists and activists.`,
          paragraph2: `<strong>Inspiration:</strong> Are you old enough to remember when Blair Witch Project (1999) was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/08/how-the-blair-witch-project-changed-horror-for-ever" target="_blank">most important movie in the world</a>? Sánchez and Myrick’s low-budget ‘found footage’ hit changed what was acceptable in cinema and horror. We reckon the folk-horror feel echoes the <a href="https://blog.eccu.edu/pegasus-spyware-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank">Greek myth inspiration</a> behind Pegasus. And the night vision and time stamps of the 1990s camcorder effect remind us that your phone’s camera can tell a story – and you never know who might be watching.`

          title: `Game Over <span>(Edgar Wright on DDoS)</span>`,
          image: require("./assets/images/05-Digital-Nightmares-game_over.jpg"),
          paragraph1: `<a href="https://surfshark.com/use-cases/vpn-for-gaming" target="_blank">Distributed denial-of-service</a> (DDoS) is what happens when hackers overwhelm a server or network with internet traffic, causing it to crash. When a rival gamer figures your IP, they can target your system and slow your connection – and your gaming aptitude – to a standstill.`,
          paragraph2: `<strong>Inspiration:</strong> All those fake requests flooding your server reminded us of the zombies and intergalactic androids swarming over the bookends of Edgar Wright’s Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy: <a href="https://screenrant.com/shaun-of-the-dead-spoof-zombie-movies/" target="_blank">Shaun of the Dead</a> and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/simon-pegg-nick-frost-get-drunk-battle-robots-worlds-end-trailer-video-98201/" target="_blank">The World’s End</a>. Plus, Wright is known for his kinetic tributes to gaming and movie tropes. Finally, his characters all seem the type to, you know… be lazing around at home playing games when a DDoS attack drops in from nowhere to ruin their life.`
