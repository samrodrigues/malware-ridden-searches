    paragraph: `Hollywood actors are among the most searched for celebrities in the world, in many cases outranking athletes, musicians, and politicians in internet search activity. As a result, they are a prime target for cybercriminals looking to boost their malicious websites with popular search terms. Even the names of the most <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/02/12/tom-hanks-tops-our-list-of-the-most-trustworthy-celebrities/?sh=1c573acc4d54" target="_blank">trustworthy</a> actors – Tom Hanks, for example – can be co-opted by hackers. Search results for Tom Hanks have a 51.6% probability of containing potential malware, one of the highest percentages of any actor. `,

    paragraph: `Actresses are slightly less dangerous to Google than actors but are still among the most dangerous pop culture categories to search for online. Search terms tend to get riskier the more they are trending, and many of the most dangerous actresses to search for made headlines in recent years. Search results for Margot Robbie, for example, started in three back-to-back hits from 2019 to 2021 — <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Birds of Prey</em>, and <em>The Suicide Squad</em> – are more likely to contain potential malware than not. </p><p>Some 52.0% of search results for Margot Robbie contain potential malware, the second-largest share of any actress. Searches for Faye Dunaway – the eighth most dangerous actress – spiked in summer 2019 when the actress was  <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/faye-dunaway-fired-from-broadway-bound-tea-at-five/" target="_blank">fired from a Broadway play</a> which may have led hackers to seize on the increase in popularity. `,

    paragraph: `While the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/piracy-significantly-declining-due-to-availability-of-streaming-services/" target="_blank">illegal downloading of movies declined</a> in tandem with the rise of streaming services, <a href="https://www.mobilemarketingmagazine.com/the-rise-in-online-piracy-" target="_blank">visits to film piracy websites increased significantly during the COVID-19</a> pandemic. Cyber attackers have likely seized on the increase in film piracy to promote malicious software links within searches for movie downloads. Many of the most dangerous films to search for have younger audiences, who are more likely to click on links containing malicious software.

This could be a result of people looking for series to binge as means of making the most of an unspecified time period of staying indoors. Hackers likely exploited the increase in piracy activity by attaching more malware to search results related to popular “binge-worthy” television shows, such as Breaking Bad.

Other dangerous books to search for with young audiences include <em>Breaking Dawn</em> by Stephenie Meyer and <em>Harry Potter</em> by J.K. Rowling. Fans of Dan Brown may want to hold off on searching altogether, as three of the top 10 highest-risk searches are books penned by the <em>Da Vinci Code</em> author. `,

But while efforts to stem piracy may make video games less of a target for cybercriminals, downloadable mods – new in-game content that independent developers create and distribute to players – allow hackers a major opportunity to lure gamers to malware.
